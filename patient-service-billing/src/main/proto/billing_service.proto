//Proto file is used to define the BillingService for patient service billing operations.
//gRPC is a high-performance way for backend services to talk to each other using binary data over HTTP/2, making it much faster and more efficient than REST.
// A proto file defines the shared contract between services — it specifies the methods, request types, and response types.
// From this single file, gRPC automatically generates client and server code in any language, ensuring both sides follow the exact same structure.
// Because of this strong typing, speed, and automatic code generation, gRPC is widely used in microservices and large distributed systems.
//It helps in generating client and server code for gRPC communication.
//gRPC is a high-performance RPC framework that uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features such as authentication, load balancing, and more.
